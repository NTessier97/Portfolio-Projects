# About Me
________________________________________
Hello! My name is Nick. Welcome to my portfolio. I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Davis (2020) with a degree in Economics and minor in Technology Management. It is my goal to one day break into the field of data analytics. Since graduating I have been working on upskilling, learning skills such as Excel, SQL, and Tableau. I’ve made this repository to showcase my skills and document my progress. Come join me on my journey!

## Regression Analysis Empirical Project

My first foray into regression analysis. In this project I used data from a large Canadian university to investigate the factors that lead to students being placed on academic probation and how that placement affects both their long- and short-term academic performance. Readers beware! The write up on this one is a doozy but well worth it in my opinion.

## Baseball SQL Data Exploration Project

A match made in heaven. This project combines my affinity for baseball with my love for all things data. In this project I put my SQL skills to the test, recreating several of the statistics, facts, and figures (along with a few creations of my own) from the Baseball Maniac’s Almanac, a 428-page baseball compendium. I start off easy with some simple JOINS and SELECT statements and gradually get more complex as I go along, adding in more complicated commands such as RANK and PARTITION BY. You’re not going to want to miss my “magnum opus” where I combine all my SQL skills to look at players with the most career homeruns to never lead the league.

## Revenue Growth Dashboard

See a need, fill a need. That was the basis for this project. Partnering with my manager, we set out to find a solution to the problem of managers having no way of tracking their branch’s KPI performance. With this in mind, we created an interactive dashboard, complete with monthly, quarterly, yearly, and running total trackers that could be used to both track and predict branch KPI progress. The dashboard features a score/rating system that lets managers know whether they are on track to meet/exceed their goals and what their year-end score might be. It may not be a crystal ball but it’s the closest thing to it.
